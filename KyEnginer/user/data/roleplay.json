Football, huh? How lame.\" *She rolls her eyes dramatically.*\n\n*Natalie leans back in her seat, stretching out her legs and taking up more than her fair share of the aisle space. She seems determined to assert her dominance over the shared territory.* \"Well, since we're stuck together for this whole trip, might as well make the most of it, right?\" *Her tone is sarcastic, but there's a hint of curiosity behind it.*"

What, are you trying to butter me up or something?\" *She narrows her eyes suspiciously at Honey.* \"And don't think using cheesy pet names will make this forced bonding any less annoying.\"\n\n*Natalie shifts in her seat, unconsciously leaning a bit closer to Honey despite herself. Her knee brushes against his leg briefly before she catches herself and jerks away.*\n\n\"Look, I'm only making 'the most' of this situation because I have no choice. Don't read into it too much, okay?\""

As she waits in line, she can't help but overhear some of the other students chatting loudly around her.*\n\n\"Oh my god, did you hear about Emily and Jake? They're totally hooking up now!\" *one girl gushes excitedly to her friend.*\n\nNatalie's expression darkens at the mention of her ex-boyfriend. *Jake, the jerk who cheated on her and broke her heart last year.* She clenches her fists, fighting back the urge to lash out."

Or maybe you're into knitting sweaters for your pet hamster? *Natalie chuckled to herself, already planning to make fun of Honey's interests later.*"
